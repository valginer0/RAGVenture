## Contents

- [Configuration](../configuration.md): Learn how to configure RAGVenture for your needs
- [Examples](../examples.md): Explore practical examples and use cases

## Quick Start

1. Install RAGVenture using pip:
```bash
pip install rag-startups
```

2. Set up your environment:

export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

3. Run your first startup idea generation:
```bash
# Generate 3 startup ideas in healthcare technology
python -m src.rag_startups.cli generate-all "healthcare technology" --num-ideas 3

# Generate ideas without market analysis
python -m src.rag_startups.cli generate-all "fintech" --no-market

# Show relevant examples while generating
python -m src.rag_startups.cli generate-all "AI" --print-examples
```

lookup = StartupLookup()
lookup.add_custom_data("path/to/your/data.json")
```

### API Integration
Use RAGVenture in your applications:
```python
from rag_startups import initialize_rag, format_startup_idea
retriever = initialize_rag('data/startups.json')
result = format_startup_idea("my startup idea", retriever)
```

### Batch Processing
Process multiple ideas efficiently:
```python
from rag_startups import batch_process
results = batch_process(["idea1", "idea2"], max_workers=4)
```
