- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/valginer0/rag_startups.git`
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
4. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies with development extras
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Process

1. **Code Style**
   - We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
   - Use type hints where possible
   - Keep functions focused and modular

2. **Documentation**
   - Document all functions and classes
   - Update README.md if adding new features
   - Add examples to docs/examples.md
   - Update API documentation in docs/api.md

3. **Testing** (177 tests - all passing)
   - Run full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
   - Docker tests: `docker-compose run --rm app-cpu python -m pytest tests/ -v`
   - All tests must pass before submitting PR
   - Add tests for new features and bug fixes
   - Current coverage: Comprehensive with Docker runtime fixes

4. **Docker Development**
   - Docker containers are production-ready and fully tested
   - Test your changes in Docker: `docker-compose up app-cpu`
   - Verify Docker compatibility before submitting PR
   - All Docker runtime issues have been resolved

5. **Original Testing Guidelines**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Ensure all tests pass: `python -m pytest`
   - Add test cases for edge cases
   - Maintain test coverage

4. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format:
     - feat: new feature
     - fix: bug fix
     - docs: documentation changes
     - style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
     - refactor: code restructuring
     - test: adding tests
     - chore: maintenance

## Testing

We maintain a comprehensive test suite with 31 passing tests. Before submitting your PR:

1. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. Ensure test coverage:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=rag_startups tests/
   ```

3. Key test files:
   - `tests/test_rag_chain.py`: Core RAG functionality
   - `tests/idea_generator/test_generator.py`: Idea generation
   - `tests/test_data_loader.py`: Data loading and processing

4. Performance benchmarks (tests will fail if exceeded):
   - Data Loading: < 0.1s
   - Embedding Generation: < 25s
   - Idea Generation: < 1s per idea

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Update the version numbers if applicable
6. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
